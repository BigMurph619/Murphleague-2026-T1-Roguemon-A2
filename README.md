|        Bonus Points       |
| :-----------------------: |
|Any Pokemon that is 440 BST or lower will accumulate DOUBLE points. If the Pokemon is evolved into over 440 BST it will resume receiving standard points for the remainder of that run. All rules regarding abilities still apply i.e. (a 430 BST Pokemon may NOT have shell armor).|
|Static Fanatic - Whoever guesses the primary typing of the most (all runs combined) static encounters (Tower Ghost, Snorlaxes, Legendary Birds) will earn 1 bonus point (must have clip linked with score updates). |
|Flutist - Collect all five colored flutes (Yellow, Blue, Red, Black, White) in a single run and earn 1 bonus point (must have clip linked with score updates).|
|Linking Mons - Successfully execute an in-game trade to earn 1 bonus point. NOTE: In-game trades ask for the same pokemon as the vanilla game. You may NOT farm extra catches to obtain these Pokemon...they must be obtained legally (i.e. early game pivot option).
|Which Switch - Complete Surge's trash puzzle first try and earn 1 bonus point! (must have clip linked with score updates).|
|Go to Class - Send a clip to BennyTots of the reward you get for solving the below riddle to get a bonus point:<br>A chalky board stands by my side,<br>Where tips for Trainers often reside.<br>I have the ability to run away,<br>but with you as my trainer I may stay.|

Curse conquerer - most curses cleared in scoring runs.


|Sevii Island Champion's Quest|
| :-----------------------: |
|If you're so fortunate as to conquer NATDEX Monomon, you may take on the post game quest on the Sevii Islands (NOTE: You need the NATDEX in order to access this, so just ensure you have it at the start of the game). Starting with the Rocket Grunts on 1 Island, you will treat the entire rest of the game as a dungeon (no Pokecenters allowed). You must sell all TMs beforehand and may only teach TMs/Move Tutors that were not available prior to the post game. You may NOT enter cerulean cave before going back to the islands. You will need to MANUALLY track how many trainers you defeat; the competitor who defeats the most trainers will earn 3 bonus points|
